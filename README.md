# Trie Autocomplete

- Given that we have a trie data structure.

- Add the ability to list suffixes to implement our autocomplete feature.

- To do that, implement a new function on the TrieNode object that will return all complete word suffixes that exist below it in the trie. 

- For example, if our Trie contains the words ["fun", "function", "factory"] and we ask for suffixes from the f node, we would expect to receive ["un", "unction", "actory"] back from node.suffixes()


# How to use it

- Run `./main.py` what will execute the test cases in `./tests` and a demo
